Any additional assets (e.g. images) used in the website



Features
A hero section that provides a brief introduction to you and your background.

A resume page that lists your education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information (you can link to Capstone project 1).

A section that showcases any projects or work that you have done in the past.

An about me section that provides additional information about you and your interests.

A contact me section that includes information for users to get in touch with you.



Technical Requirements
All HTML should be valid and follow proper semantic markup.

All CSS should be valid and follow best practices for naming conventions and organization.

The website should be responsive and work on different screen sizes and devices.

All images used in the website should have appropriate alt text to be accessible.



Timeline

Hour 4: Finalize design and content, make any necessary revisions, optimize for performance.

Hour 5: Launch the website and share with others in the Q&A for feedback, make any final adjustments.



FAQs
1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?

Yes! That's the point of these capstone projects. Unlike course projects, which have solution code and video walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are meant to be entirely your "own work". There are over a million students who have enrolled on this web development course worldwide. If you add a course project to your portfolio, it's very likely that your client will know it's from this course. The capstone projects on the other hand, have no solution code, no walk through, no design specs. It's it purely your creation So it can definitely be counted as your own work and be added to your portfolio.

When I hire developers, I always ask for a portfolio. I consider what they have built by themselves to be far more important than which University they went to or if they have a computer science degree. Many of my friends who are CEOs in multi-nationals and startups agree.
