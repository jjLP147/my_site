<p>Originally from the United States, I chose adventure over stability at home.</p>

<p>After learning professional-level Japanese during and through university, the infamous COVID-19 struck and shut down my accepted job as well as the whole world.</p>

<p>I then looked for other opportunities and was introduced to South Korea by my pastor and his wife.</p>

<p>Seeing the opportunity to learn another language and culture even in the middle of the pandemic, I took an opportunity to come to South Korea and have been working here since.</p>
