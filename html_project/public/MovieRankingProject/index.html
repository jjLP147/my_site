<h3>The Northman</h3>

<img src="./the-northman_poster.png" style="width:500px" alt="The poster of the movie featuring Alexander Skarsgard, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, and Anya Taylor Joy" />

<p>This movie will immerse you in the mindsets and cultures of 1000A.D. Northern Europe.<br>
As a man of Norse descent and a fan of ancient history and the so-called "Viking Age," <br>
this movie spoke to me on levels most films cannot. <br>

<p>The film follows Prince Amleth in his quest for vengeance against his father's killer. </p>

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<img src="./schindlers_list_girl.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="A picture of the famous Girl in Red" />
<p>This should need no introduction; it is frequently cited on Best Movies of All Time lists, <br>
    expecially those surrounding WWII.</p>
    <img src="./schindlers_list_oskar_schindler.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="a picture of Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler in the film" />
    <p>This movie follows one Oskar Schindler, a National Socialist Party member <br>
    in 1930s-1940s Germany. He tries to keep Jewish people safe from the Third Reich <br>
    under the guise of using them for labor.</p>

<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<img src="./q9JwFktEfzdXlE7gFjKSTOD3jpK.jpg" style="width:500px" alt="A picture of Hiccup the Viking lad and Toothless the Dragon looking at one another with understanding" />
<p>A fun break from the seriousness of the other two movies; <br>
    this one follows the antics of a Viking lad named Hiccup and his journey <br>
    to gain respect and renown in his homeland.
